# Product Groups

Product Groups allow you to assign different general ledger accounts based on the type of product or service you are selling. This is useful when you want to understand your sales mix — for example, separating revenue from physical goods, services, and subscriptions into different accounts.

To create a Product Group:

1. Go to **Master Data** > **Sales** > **Product Groups**.
2. Click **New** to create a group.
3. Assign the appropriate revenue, cost, and inventory G/L accounts.
4. When creating or editing a product, select the Product Group so transactions post to the correct accounts.
