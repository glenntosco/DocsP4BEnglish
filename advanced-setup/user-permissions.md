# User Permissions

On this screen you can configure user roles, which control permissions for which areas of the system each user can access.

To configure user permissions:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Users and Roles**.
2. Select an existing role or click **New** to create a custom role.
3. Enable or disable access for each module — such as Sales, Purchasing, Accounting, and Inventory.
4. Assign the role to one or more users.

{% hint style="info" %}
P4 Books comes with default roles. You can modify these or create new roles to match your organization's structure. Changes to a role take effect the next time the user logs in.
