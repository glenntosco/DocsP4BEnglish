## Setup Checklist

Define the fiscal periods for your organization (e.g. 2024). Transactions cannot be posted without an open accounting period.

Set up the government entity to which you remit sales tax (e.g. DGI Panama).

Configure your sales tax rates (e.g. ITBMS 7%). Tax codes are managed at the product level and the customer level.

### Step 4 — [Payment Terms](payment-terms.md)

Define your payment terms — Net 30, Net 60, Cash, etc. These are assigned to customers and vendors.

### Step 5 — [Chart of Accounts](chart-of-accounts/README.md)

Review and configure your general ledger accounts. Includes [Banking](chart-of-accounts/banking.md) setup for bank accounts, credit cards, and lines of credit.

Set up the warehouse or store locations where your inventory will be held.

### Step 7 — [Opening Balances](opening-balances.md)
