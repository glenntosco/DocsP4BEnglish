# Tax Codes

Here you will enter your sales tax codes — there may be one or several. Setting a default tax code will apply that tax code to all products and services.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tax codes are managed at two levels — on the product and on the customer — depending on the type of product and customer in terms of how tax codes are applied.

If you are in a country such as Panama that has sales tax withholding, you will configure this on the Customer Screen.
