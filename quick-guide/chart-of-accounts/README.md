# Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts is the foundation of any accounting system. Here you can rename accounts, delete accounts, and create new accounts. There are default accounts pre-assigned to functions — if you change these, we recommend speaking with your accountant to ensure you have the accounts you need before beginning transactions.
