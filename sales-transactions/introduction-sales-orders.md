# Introduction - Sales Orders

A sales order is a document sent to customers to confirm the items and prices of a sale. A sales order is typically created after your customers accept a quote and your items are ready to be shipped or delivered.

The sales order workflow in P4 Books is as follows:

* Create a sales order detailing the items you will sell to your customers and their prices. Click the Lock button to save the sales order and prevent accidental changes.
* Once the sales order is locked, you can create the delivery, create the invoice, create a purchase order...

If your P4 Books is integrated with P4 Warehouse, you will not have the option to create a delivery document. The delivery document will be sent from your warehouse once the order has been picked and packed for shipping.
