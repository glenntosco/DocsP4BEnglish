# Carriers

On this screen you will set up your various freight carriers. These carriers apply to both sales and purchases. Each carrier can have a different general ledger account, or they can all share the same account, depending on what your accountant or accounting department recommends. Assigning each carrier to a separate general ledger account simplifies reporting on how much you are spending with each carrier.

If you use your own trucks for shipping, or if you have divided an area into fixed freight zones, add the fixed cost to the transport company to save time entering the amount on each order. There is also a field for transport insurance...
