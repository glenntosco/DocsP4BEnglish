# Products

## Products <a href="#items" id="items"></a>

Products are the goods or services you work with in your business.

Whenever you create transactions for your customers or vendors, you can add these items and their details will be filled in automatically.

From here you can:

* Add a new product
* Import products
* Export products

As you will see below, the main difference between P4 Books and other ERP systems is our ability to track serial numbers, lot numbers, expiry dates, bills of materials, pack sizes (units, inner packs, boxes, pallets), barcodes, UPCs, and items with decimal control. In addition, P4 Books can handle all your shipping needs and compliance requirements.
