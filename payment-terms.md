# Payment Terms

Payment terms define the conditions under which you expect payment from customers or vendors — for example, Net 30, Net 60, Cash, etc. Payment terms are assigned to customers and vendors; however, when posting documents this setting can be changed to reflect the payment method of the specific transaction.

This screen only requires the payment code and the number of days.

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting up payment terms helps with cash flow reporting and aging analysis. Assign default terms to each customer and vendor to save time when creating transactions.
{% endhint %}
