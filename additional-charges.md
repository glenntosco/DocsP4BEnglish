# Additional Charges

Additional charges are costs added to a purchase order for items such as insurance, documentation fees, customs duties, and handling charges. Each charge can be assigned to a different general ledger account so you can track and report on these costs separately.

To create an Additional Charge:

1. Go to **Master Data** > **Purchasing** > **Additional Charges**.
2. Click **New**.
3. Enter the charge code, description, and the G/L account where the cost should be posted.

Additional charges are applied at the purchase order level. They do not affect the unit cost of individual products but are recorded as separate expenses.
