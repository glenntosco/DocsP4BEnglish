# Introduction - Purchase Orders

A purchase order is a document you send to your vendors detailing all the items you plan to purchase from them and their cost. After your vendor accepts the purchase order, you will wait for the products to arrive to generate a receiving document, then generate a vendor invoice, and finally a vendor payment.
